# Spigot-Plugin

This project is just a template for other users to use when starting off their spigot plugin. There is no use for this unless you modify it to your project. 

Installation
------------

Clone this git repository into your workspace and make a new project depending on what IDE you are using and depending on which IDE you are using it may automatically set it up for you, but if it doesn't then open a file and use the file you cloned. You will need to enable the Maven nature, and after doing that you can start coding!

Additionally,

Rename the "pinkyneel.dev" package to reflect your own namespace. (tld.yourdomain.whatever)
Edit the pom.xml to reflect your project properties. Work slowly through this if you are still new to using Maven.

Make This Your Own Project
--------------------------
Feel free to clone this project and make adjustments to fit your needs/preferences.
